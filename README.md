# Potato Game

Potato game is a proof-of-concept custom blockchain implementation.
The current design allows a small pool of verifiers maintain a blockchain that keep track of a video game server state.
Players can join the game and submit transactions.
The game state cannot be subverted unless the majority of verifiers in the pool are malicious.
